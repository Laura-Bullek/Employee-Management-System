# Employee-Management-System

## Description
The **Employee-Management-System** is a project from the March-August 2021 cohort from University of New Hampshire's full-stack web development course. 

Our task is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

Technologies are listed below.  

## User Story
 - As a business owner
 - I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
 - So that I can organize and plan my business

## Acceptance Criteria
* Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

* Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

* Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.

* You may wish to have a separate file containing functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. Could a constructor function or a class be helpful for organizing these?

* You will need to perform a variety of SQL JOINS to complete this assignment, and it's recommended you review the week's activities if you need a refresher on this.
